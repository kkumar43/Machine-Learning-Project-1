# Machine-Learning-Project-1
Density estimation and classification
In this part, you need to first perform parameter estimation for a given dataset (which is a subset from the MNIST dataset). 
The MNIST dataset contains 70,000 images of handwritten digits, divided into 60,000 training images and 10,000 testing images.
You will submit the code and a report explaining your approach and the math you used.
